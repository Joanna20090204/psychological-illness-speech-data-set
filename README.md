# psychological-illness-speech-data-set
This is a data set that records what people with psychological illness say, all in Chinese. There are four categories of psychological illness: depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD),normal,panic disorder,eating disorder and others. I got these datasets from Weibo Chaohua and Baidu Tieba in China. This is a great channel to help chinese people study psychological.I created this dataset so that a computer can judge psychological illness based on what people say.
PS.In this data set:

0 refers to depression;

1 refers to anxiety;

2 refers to bipolar disorder;

3 refers to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD);

4 refers to normal;

5 refers to panic disorder;

6 refers to eating disorder;

7 refers to others(which means it affects their lives but we can't tell what kind of psychological illness it is)

There are 21,236 pieces of data. I will continue to expand my dataset.And I wish you can give me some nice suggestions.Thank you.

这是一个记录人们言论的数据集，全中文。心理疾病分为四类:抑郁、焦虑、躁郁症（双相情感障碍）和创伤后应激障碍(PTSD)，人们正常的语言，恐慌症，厌食症和暴食症和其他疾病。我从中国的微博超话和百度贴吧中获得了这些数据集。这是一个好渠道来帮助中国人学习心理学。我创建这个数据集是为了让计算机可以根据人们说的话来判断心理疾病。
备注：在这个数据集中：

0代表抑郁症

1代表焦虑症

2代表躁郁症（双向情感障碍）

3代表创伤后应激障碍

4代表正常

5代表恐慌症

6代表厌食症和暴食症

7代表其他疾病（它会影响人们的生活，但是无法判断它是哪种心理疾病）

它一共有21236条数据。我将继续扩展我的数据集。我希望你能给我一些好的建议。谢谢你！
